# elm-compression [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zimmydev/elm-compression.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zimmydev/elm-compression)
A general-purpose compression library written in (and written for) Elm. This package does not include every compression method; rather, it includes implementations of common coding and compression schemes. These schemes are written modularly in a such a way that composing them into more complex schemes is easy and relatively straight-forward (that's the hope). For example,
